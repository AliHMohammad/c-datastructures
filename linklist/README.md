## Structure

### `Node`
The `Node` structure represents an element in the linked list and has the following members:
- `int data`: Holds the integer value of the node.
- `Node* nextNode`: A pointer to the next node in the list.
- `Node* prevNode`: A pointer to the previous node in the list.

### `LinkedList`
The `LinkedList` structure represents the linked list and has the following members:
- `Node* head`: A pointer to the first node in the list.
- `Node* tail`: A pointer to the last node in the list.

## Functions

### `LinkedList* linkedlist()`
Creates and initializes an empty linked list. Allocates memory for the LinkedList structure and sets both `head` and `tail` to `NULL`. Returns a pointer to the newly created linked list.

### `Node* node()`
Creates and initializes an empty node. Allocates memory for the node and sets `data`, `nextNode`, and `prevNode` to `NULL`. Returns a pointer to the newly created node.

### `void add_first(LinkedList* list, int value)`
Adds a new node with the given `value` to the beginning of the list. Updates the `head` pointer to point to the new node. If the list is empty, sets the `tail` to the new node.

### `void add_last(LinkedList* list, int value)`
Adds a new node with the given `value` to the end of the list. Updates the `tail` pointer to point to the new node. If the list is empty, sets the `head` to the new node.

### `void add_index(LinkedList* list, unsigned int index, int value)`
Inserts a new node with the given `value` at the specified `index`. Shifts the nodes to accommodate the new element. If the index is out of bounds, adds the node to the end of the list. Prints an error message if the index is invalid.

### `void remove_index(LinkedList* list, int index)`
Removes the node at the specified `index`. Adjusts pointers of the neighboring nodes to maintain the list structure. If the index is 0, removes the first node. If the index is out of bounds, removes the last node. Prints an error message if the index is invalid.

### `void remove_first(LinkedList* list)`
Removes the first node from the list and updates the `head` pointer to point to the next node. If the list becomes empty, sets `tail` to `NULL`.

### `void remove_last(LinkedList* list)`
Removes the last node from the list and updates the `tail` pointer to point to the previous node. If the list becomes empty, sets `head` to `NULL`.

### `void swap(LinkedList* list, unsigned int indexOne, unsigned int indexTwo)`
Swaps the nodes at the specified `indexOne` and `indexTwo`. Adjusts pointers to maintain the correct order. If the indices are the same or out of bounds, the function returns without making changes.

### `void print_list(LinkedList* list)`
Prints the properties of the linked list, including the address and data of the `head` and `tail` nodes. Iterates through the list and prints each nodeâ€™s address, data, and links to the next and previous nodes.

### How to run:

Windows: 
```bash
source ./run.sh
```

OSX:
```bash
source ./run_os.sh
```
